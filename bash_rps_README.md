# **Rock Paper Scissors Time!**

This is just a fun game to practice more OOP in bash format. While making a game I can play on the side when im bored compiling code.

2 things I would like to change about the setup.
The 1st being I should abstract out asking the player if they want to play again. I basically redo that part multiple times because I wanted different echo messages for different things. But I could probably keep the same logic in a function & pass an argument on the output message, to keep it flexible & reduce total code length.

The 2nd the score board & general game process. It would be fun to make it a little more interative & animated. The game logic is fine but it would be more fun to hype up the game decision making & final results. 

I may also be asking ther user too much each time if they want to keep playing. It might be better to let the game run for best out of 3, then ask the user if they want to play again or stop. If they continue I could keep the scoreboard going.
